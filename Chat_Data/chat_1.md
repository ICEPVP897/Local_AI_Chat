**User:** create a python program which will print from 1 to 100

**Assistant:**

Here is one way you can achieve this using Python. You can use the `range()` function in combination with a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 100 and then print each number. Here's an example code snippet that accomplishes this task:
```python
for i in range(1, 101):
    print(i)
```
This will output all the integers from 1 to 100 on separate lines.
